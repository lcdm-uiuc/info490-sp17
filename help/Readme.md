# The help folder
## A good place to start when you're stuck

In this folder, you can find various resources that your TAs have made that will help you
to problem solve on your own, and know when to ask for help.  In this folder you can find:
- [How to read error messages and ask informative questions in forum posts](read_error_mes.md)
- [How to correctly completed peer grading](peer_grading_instruct.md)
- [A flow chart that helps you to debug your code](Debugging_flow_chart.pdf)
- [How to activate your assignments tab in Jupyter](act_assign_tab.md)

If these resources don't help, look in the [Wiki](https://github.com/lcdm-uiuc/info490-sp17/wiki) above BEFORE posting to the class forum!

Many more will follow, so please be on the lookout for updates!
